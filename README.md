Node.js Basics

Intro of Node.js:

1. JS DONT HAVE FUNCTAIONALITIES TO BUILD BACKEND
2. V8 ENGINE WITH javascript  ==== NODE.JS
3. NODEJS is a js runtime environment


Install node & npm(PACKAGE STORE)
Working with modules

File System op:

1. rmdir: Removes a directory (deprecated, use fs.rm instead).
2. unlink: Deletes a specified file.
3. copyFile: Copies a file from one location to another.
4. rename: Renames or moves a file to a new path.
5. appendFile: Appends data to a file, creating it if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
6. writeFile: Writes data to a file, replacing existing content if any.

Understanding HTTP modules

1. HTTP and HTTPS
2. Protocols





<!-- DAY 3: -->

1. What is npm?


npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It helps developers install, manage, and share JavaScript libraries and tools.
<!-- Key Features of npm: -->
... Package Management - Allows you to install and update JavaScript libraries easily.
... Dependency Management - Handles dependencies for projects using package.json.
... Script Running - Lets you automate tasks using npm run scripts.
... Publishing Packages - Allows developers to share their own packages with the community.
... Global and Local Installations - You can install packages globally (-g) or locally (project-specific).




2. install and uninstall anything basics and advanced

    (install -->  npm i packageName )
    (uninstall -->  npm uninstall package name)

3. Install particular version of package 
    npm i packagename@version
    <!-- eg - npm i accessibility@3.0.1 -->
  
4. Node_Modules

--- node_modules is a folder where all the dependencies (packages) installed via npm or yarn are stored.
--- Every project using Node.js and npm has a package.json file, which lists the project's dependencies.
--- The package-lock.json file ensures consistent package versions across installations.


5. dependencies 
- Used in production ‚Äì These are essential for the project to run ( packages and packages' dependencies)


4. DEVdependencies 
- Used only during development ‚Äì These are tools that help in testing, linting, or building the project but are not required in production.




5. scripts - understanding default scripts PATH and custom scripts

üõ† What Are npm Scripts?
npm scripts allow you to run commands from package.json without typing long shell commands.

üîπ Built-in (Predefined) Scripts
npm has some predefined scripts that run without using npm run. These include:

npm start ‚Üí Runs the "start" script.
npm test ‚Üí Runs the "test" script.
npm stop ‚Üí Runs the "stop" script.
‚ùó Only start, test, stop, and restart can be run without npm run.

üîπCustom scripts
You can define your own scripts in package.json. Run with run command. (i created milan as a custom script.)






<!----- DAY-4 ----->


Express.js framework:

What is a Framework?
A framework is a pre-built structure that provides a foundation for developing applications. It includes ready-to-use tools, libraries, and best practices, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than setting up everything from scratch.


1. Intro to express.js
---It simplifies backend development by providing powerful routing, middleware support, and HTTP utility methods.
---Manages everything from recieving the request and giving the response


2. Setting up a basic Express application  npm i express

3. Routing   
---Routing in Express.js determines how an application responds to different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for specific URLs (routes).
<!-- app.get(route , requestHandler) -->     /--> main page      /profile--> profile page




4. MiddleWare
<!-- sasti bhasha mai -->
whenever server accepts the request, from there to reach the end we can do anything in middle.....that is called middleware.
<!-- english mai hehehe-->
Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that execute during the request-response cycle. They modify, process, or handle requests before they reach the final route or response.




5. Request and response handling
---req (Request Object): Contains details about the HTTP request (URL, headers, body, parameters, etc.).
---res (Response Object): Used to send back responses to the client.



6. Error handling

Express.js provides a structured way to handle errors efficiently, preventing server crashes and improving debugging.

üîπ Types of Errors in Express.js
1Ô∏è‚É£ Synchronous Errors ‚Äì Errors that occur inside normal route handlers.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Asynchronous Errors ‚Äì Errors that occur inside asynchronous operations (e.g., setTimeout, database calls).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Client Errors ‚Äì Errors caused by invalid client requests (e.g., 404 Not Found).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Server Errors ‚Äì Internal server failures (e.g., database crashes).

Default error handler middleware--

<!-- 
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack); // Log the error
    res.status(500).send("something wrong");
}); 
-->
